# My Mac Setup
Lame name. Simple script. Work in progress.

If you want to set your git user name and email, update `user.config` with your name and email BEFORE running the script.

If you do NOT want to setup your git user info, uncomment the lines under `# Configure git user info`

Run with `sh mac_setup.sh` and periodically check in on the script to give your password/etc (see improvement listing).

## Improvement List

- Have user give password up front and pass it along wherever needed to avoid needing to babysit the script to keep it going.
- Pass through confirmation prompts (avoid more babysitting).
